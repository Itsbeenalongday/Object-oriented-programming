Cause of error
:
As mentioned in task3, if you write nothing before classname, 
it becomes the default access property and cannot be accessed from other packages.
This is why an error occurs

How can I fix error?
:
Save Account.java file and AccountTest.java file in the same package or 
add Public in front of class name in source code of Account.java.
